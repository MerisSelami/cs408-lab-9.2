The program displays multiple colored balls that move and bounce around the screen, changing color when they collide. A controllable “Evil Circle,” outlined in white, can be moved using the W, A, S, and D keys to “consume” the balls. Each time a ball is eaten, the Ball count displayed at the top of the screen decreases.
